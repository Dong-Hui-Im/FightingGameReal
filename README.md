 This is the fighting game I have created called Blazing Chain. As of now, only one character is (barely) playable. 
 
 Player one controls are a and d to move left and right, and q for attack
 Player two controls are the left and right arrow keys to move left and right, and n for attack
 Use your mouse to navigate the buttons on the main menu, character select, and character win scenes.

 you win by beating your opponent twice in three rounds
 Have fun!
